## Highlights

- **High-throughput scanner** â€“ Leverages `ThreadPoolExecutor`, bounded queues and adaptive worker limits to sweep massive IPv4 ranges without saturating your network links.
- **Protocol-aware verification** â€“ Performs full Java status handshakes (with `mcstatus` support when installed) to surface version hints, MOTDs, player counts and latency measurements.
- **Deterministic IP randomisation** â€“ The Feistel-based `permuted_index_generator` lets you reshuffle scan order while guaranteeing that every host is visited exactly once.
- **Battle-tested proxy rotation** â€“ `ProxyPool` tracks SOCKS5 endpoint health, enforces exponential cooldowns and exposes live metrics so long-running sweeps stay reliable.
- **Mullvad automation ready** â€“ `MullvadManager` integrates with the Mullvad CLI/SDK to rotate exit IPs and keep your proxy fleet fresh during multi-hour scans.
- **Persistent, shareable storage** â€“ `StorageManager` writes confirmed hits, open-port leads and saved GUI state to text/JSON artefacts you can sync or process elsewhere.
- **Modular architecture** â€“ All engine components live in the `mcsmartscan` package, making it easy to embed scanning, proxy or storage helpers in your own tooling.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and enter the project directory.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/braydos-h/Minecraft-Server-Finder.git
   cd Minecraft-Server-Finder
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies and optional helpers.
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the GUI.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

> [!TIP]
> Prefer clickable helpers? Use `install_system.bat` to install tooling system-wide on Windows, or run `pyinstaller.ps1` for a ready-to-ship executable without manually invoking PyInstaller.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Tkinter (bundled with most Python installs; optional if you only need headless mode)
- Optional integrations for richer telemetry:
  - [`mcstatus`](https://pypi.org/project/mcstatus/) â€“ enhanced Java status queries
  - [`python-nmap`](https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap/) â€“ cross-check suspicious ports
  - [`psutil`](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) â€“ UI system metrics
  - [`mullvad-api`](https://pypi.org/project/mullvad-api/) / [`mullvad-python`](https://pypi.org/project/mullvad-python/) â€“ advanced VPN automation

### Setup Checklist
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The scanner gracefully degrades when optional packages are missingâ€”install only what you need.

## Running

### GUI Mode

- Launch with `python app.py`.
- Configure IP ranges, port lists, worker counts, proxy settings and Mullvad cycling directly in the UI.
- Real-time logs stream alongside the results table, which surfaces latency bars, MOTDs, protocol hints and timestamps.
- Results persist automatically to your Desktop (or a directory you choose).

### Console / Headless Mode

```bash
python app.py --nogui
```

- Ideal for servers, containers or remote automation where Tkinter is unavailable.
- Reuses the same scanning engine; you can plug in custom orchestration hooks defined in `app.py`.

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--nogui` | Force console mode even if Tkinter is present. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Display the current list of supported switches. |

## Proxy-Assisted Scanning

- Maintain your SOCKS5 pool in `mcsmartscan/mullvadproxyips.txt` (`host` or `host:port`, one per line, comments allowed).
- The GUIâ€™s **Proxy Pool** panel visualises healthy endpoints, latency, lease counts, failure streaks and cooldown timers.
- `ProxyPool` backs off misbehaving proxies, quarantines them after repeated failures and exposes event callbacks for custom dashboards.
- Pair with the Mullvad desktop app/CLI (or your own provider) to ensure endpoints are reachable before launching a scan.
- Remove or empty the proxy list to fall back to direct TCP connections.

## Windows Executable Builds

### Manual Build Steps

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm minecraft_server_finder.spec
```

The resulting `MinecraftServerFinder.exe` (in `dist/`) bundles the Mullvad proxy list plus all engine modules. Use `pyinstaller.ps1` for a scripted local build.

### Automated Releases

- Tag the repo with `v*` (e.g. `v1.2.0`) or trigger the **Build Windows Release** workflow from the Actions tab.
- GitHub Actions builds on `windows-latest`, uploads an artefact and publishes a GitHub release with the packaged executable attached.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Where to change | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start/End IP | `40.0.0.0` / `255.255.255.255` | GUI, CLI, or direct API usage | Accepts CIDR blocks and explicit start/end pairs. |
| Port list | `25565` | GUI or CLI | Add additional ports to probe Bedrock or modded servers. |
| Worker threads | `150` | GUI slider / CLI | Balance throughput against bandwidth and upstream rate limits. |
| Timeout | `4.0s` | GUI / CLI | Applies to TCP handshakes and proxy acquisition. |
| Proxy pool file | `mcsmartscan/mullvadproxyips.txt` | Filesystem | Whitespace/comments ignored; empty file disables proxying. |
| Output path | Desktop auto-detected | GUI settings / `StorageManager` | Point at shared folders to collaborate with teammates. |
| VPN cycling | Disabled | GUI toggle / `MullvadManager` | Rotate exit IPs on a schedule for long scans. |

## Output Files

Defaults live on the userâ€™s Desktop (auto-detected per platform):

- `Minecraft_Servers.txt` â€“ Confirmed servers with timestamps, version hints, player counts and MOTDs.
- `Open_Ports.txt` â€“ IP:port pairs that responded but failed Minecraft-specific validation.
- `saved_servers.json` â€“ Structured state used to repopulate the GUI tables on restart.

Override the destination path through the GUI or by instantiating `StorageManager` with a custom root inside your own integrations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tkinter missing on Linux** â€“ Install `python3-tk` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `tk` (Arch/Fedora) matching your Python version.
- **Proxy pool never becomes healthy** â€“ Ensure the SOCKS endpoints are reachable and that your VPN is connected to a SOCKS-enabled location.
- **Permission denied while writing output** â€“ Select a writable destination or run the process under an account with access to that folder.
- **False positives / empty MOTDs** â€“ Add `mcstatus` for richer handshake parsing and `python-nmap` to corroborate suspicious open ports.

## FAQ

- **Does the scanner support Bedrock servers?**  
  The default port list targets Java (`25565`), but you can add Bedrock ports (e.g. `19132`) to the GUI or CLI configuration. Bedrock-specific UDP validation is limitedâ€”use results as leads for further confirmation.

- **Can I pause and resume scans?**  
  The GUI supports stopping and restarting scans; results persist to disk via `StorageManager`, so you can resume later without losing confirmed servers.

- **Is there rate limiting?**  
  Worker counts, timeouts and proxy pool sizes provide coarse-grained control. Combine them with smaller IP ranges or custom orchestration for tighter rate limiting.

## Development

- Run the local test suite:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- Keep the codebase lint-clean:
  ```bash
  flake8 .
  ```
- Adopt optional tooling (`black`, `ruff`, `mypy`) if you prefer stricter local enforcementâ€”nothing in the repo prevents their use.
- Continuous Integration mirrors this workflow using the **Python application** action (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`).

## Contributing

- Fork the repo, create a feature branch and keep optional dependencies gated so the lightweight core remains intact.
- Test both GUI and headless flows where your changes apply.
- Update documentation (including this README) when behaviour changes.
- Bug reports are hugely valuableâ€”share reproduction steps, logs and platform details so the community can help quickly.
